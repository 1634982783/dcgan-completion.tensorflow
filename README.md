# Image Completion with Deep Learning in TensorFlow

+ [See my blog post for more details and usage instructions](http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/).
+ This repository implements Raymond Yeh and Chen Chen et al.'s paper
  [Semantic Image Inpainting with Perceptual and Contextual Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07539)
  to add image completion to
  [carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow/).
